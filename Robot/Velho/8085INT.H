/*
 * This macro allows you to use a 'C' function to handle an 8085 interrupt.
 *
 * The only parameter is the DECIMAL address of the interrupt vector.
 *
 * The macro MUST be placed IMMEDIATELY preceeding the definition of the
 * function which is to be the interrupt handler. Example:
 *
 * 		INTERRUPT(_SER_) serial_int_handler()
 * 		{
 *			/* ... Function code to handle serial interrupt ... */
 *		}
 *
 *
 * Since this is a parameterized multi-line macro, the MCP extended pre-
 * processor MUST be used. An alternative to this macro which does not
 * require MCP is to create "canned" include files for each interrupt
 * vector, and #include them before the function declarations.
 *
 * BEFORE USING THIS MACRO... you MUST modify the startup code to leave
 * room for the interrupt vectors ($0004 - $0020), Use something like
 * this at the beginning of the "prefix" file:
 *
 *					JMP		?start		Jump around vectors
 *					ORG		$0020		Start code after vectors
 *			?start	EQU		*			Startup code begins here
